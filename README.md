## Rationale

This program was forked from [here](https://github.com/layeh/kjv). Instead of
using the King James translation, I used the Douay-Rheims translation
(specifically the Challoner revision). Despite the popular misconception, the
Douay-Rheims translation is actually the oldest reliable English translation
(*yes*, even older than the King James translation). This translation includes
the Catholic deuterocanonical books:

- Tobit
- Judith
- Baruch
- Sirach
- Wisdom
- 1 Maccabees
- 2 Maccabees
- As well as a few minor additions

I find that the Douay-Rheims translation is more accurate, while also preserving
the correct Canon of the Old Testament. Not only that, but "KJV-onlyism" is
quite dumb.
